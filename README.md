# Horev-Junction
Discrete simulation of Horev juncion with different traffic light logic and statistical analysis
# Overview
This project is a discrete event simulation of the Horev Junction, designed to model and analyze traffic flow, congestion, and the impact of different traffic light strategies. The simulation is built using SimPy, a Python-based discrete event simulation library.

# Features
Models vehicle arrivals, stops, and departures at the Horev Junction.
Implements traffic light cycles and evaluates their impact on congestion.
Simulates different vehicle priorities, pedestrian crossings, and lane behaviors.
Collects and analyzes traffic flow metrics, such as waiting times and throughput.
Configurable simulation parameters for testing different scenarios.

# Project Explanation
The Horev Junction Discrete Simulation is designed to model and analyze traffic behavior at one of Haifaâ€™s busiest intersections. Using discrete event simulation, the project mimics real-world traffic conditions, including vehicle arrivals, traffic light cycles, and congestion patterns. The goal is to evaluate different traffic light configurations, optimize flow efficiency, and identify potential bottlenecks.
The simulation operates by generating vehicles at predefined rates, assigning them lanes and priorities, and managing traffic lights with adjustable timing. By running multiple iterations, the model helps in understanding the effects of various traffic scenarios, such as peak-hour congestion or adaptive signal control. The results can be used for traffic optimization studies, urban planning, or future AI-driven traffic management systems.
